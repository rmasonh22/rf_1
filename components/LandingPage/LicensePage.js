                This Software License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between you
                and AppHafen Niels Grafen that owns the Software that you are
                accessing or using(“AppHafen” or “we”). If you are agreeing to
                this Agreement not as an individual but on behalf of your
                company, government, or other entity for which you are acting
                (for example, as an employee or governmental official), then
                “you” means your entity and you are binding your entity to this
                Agreement. AppHafen may modify this Agreement from time to time,
                subject to the terms in Section “Changes to this Agreement”
                below.
              </p>
              <p>
                By clicking on the “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox)
                that is presented to you at the time of your Order, or by using
                or accessing the Software, you indicate your assent to be bound
                by this Agreement. If you do not agree to this Agreement, do not
                use or access the Software.
              </p>
              <h2>Scope of Agreement</h2>
              <p>
                This Agreement governs your initial purchase of AppHafen’s
                Software, Support and Maintenance for the Software, and any
                Additional Services, as well as any future purchases made by you
                that reference this Agreement. This Agreement includes each
                Order, the AppHafen Policies, the Product-Specific Terms, and
                any other referenced policies and terms. The term “Software”
                includes Documentation unless otherwise specified.
              </p>
              <h2>Use of the Software</h2>
              <h3>Your License Rights</h3>
              <p>
                Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, AppHafen
                grants you a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and
                non-transferable license to install and use the Software.
              </p>
              <p>
                The license grants permission to you and any person within your
                legal entity and subcontractor to access and use the Software.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are allowed to modify the source code and distribute and
                sell the modified Software as your End Product under your name.
                Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
                AppHafen has no support, warranty, indemnification or other
                obligation or liability with respect to Your Modifications or
                their combination, interaction or use with our Software.
              </p>
              <h3>Restrictions</h3>
              <p>
                You cannot re-distribute the Software or derivatives of the
                Software separately from an End Product.
              </p>
              <h3>Ownership and Feedback</h3>
              <p>
                The Software is made available on a limited license or access
                basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective
                of the use of terms such as “purchase” or “sale”. AppHafen and
                its licensors have and retain all right, title and interest,
                including all intellectual property rights, in and to AppHafen
                Technology (including the Software). From time to time, you may
                choose to submit Feedback to us. AppHafen may in connection with
                any of its products or services freely use, copy, disclose,
                license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner
                without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on
                intellectual property rights or otherwise. No Feedback will be
                considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in this
                Agreement limits AppHafen&apos;s right to independently use,
                develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether
                incorporating Feedback or otherwise.
              </p>
              <h3>Support</h3>
              <p>
                The Software is provided as is. AppHafen is under no obligation
                to repair or amend the Software due to any issue, bug, and other
                malfunction of the Software you bring to the attention of
                AppHafen. Under the sole discretion of AppHafen, an updated
                version of the Software will be distributed to you.
              </p>
              <h2>Termination</h2>
              <p>
                This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and
                continues until expiration of all License Terms, unless earlier
                terminated as set forth herein.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, your
                license to the Software terminates (even if the License Term is
                identified as “perpetual” or if no expiration date is specified
                in your Order) and you must cease using and delete all Software
                in your possession.
              </p>
              <p>
                AppHafen has the right to suspend or terminate your access to
                all or any part of the Website (https://reactapp.dev) and
                Software at any time, with or without cause, with or without
                notice, effective immediately. AppHafen reserves the right to
                refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should
                survive termination will survive termination — including,
                without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
                indemnity, and limitations of liability.
              </p>

                BE CORRECTED; (E) THE SOFTWARE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER

                DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE
                LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

                defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding
                (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or
                proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases
                AppHafen of all liability); and (3) provides to you all
                reasonable assistance, at your expense.
              </p>

              <h3> Non-Assignability</h3>
              <p>
                AppHafen may assign or delegate these Software Licence Agreement

                parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in
                full force and effect. Any failure on the part of AppHafen to
                enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a
                waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under
                this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.
              </p>
              <h3>Amendments and Complete Agreement</h3>
              <p>
